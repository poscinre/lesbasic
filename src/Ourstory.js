            <h5>ETHICAL AND TIMELESS, EACH PIECE IS A NOD TO THE QUINTESSENTIAL COOL GIRL.</h5>
            <p><strong>THE BRAND PHILOSOPHY</strong><br />
                What truly matters is how you feel in your clothes, not the number thatâ€™s on that little tag in your jeans right? This is why our brands are about what matters the most. To feel good inside out. Choose happy not a size. #feelgood<br /><br />


                Les Basics represents a considered edit of staples for your everyday wardrobe. With an emphasis on quality, versatility and fit, we embrace timeless designs that never go out of style.<br /><br />


                As a brand, we recognise our responsibility to promote a slower approach to fashion. We produce each piece in limited quantities to preserve natural resources and avoid excess. Our ethos is simple, we stand for quality over quantity and buying less, but buying better.<br /><br />

                Inclusive and unpretentious, each capsule is designed to cultivate confidence and hand-made to last. A nod to the quintessential cool girl, our collection of basics are as effortless as they are edgy.<br />
